==== Funding choices ====
	- Flexible Funding: Keep all contributions even if you donâ€™t meet your campaign goal! Flexible Funding is often a great fit if you don't have a strict go/no-go funding minimum ( Message: This campaign will receive all funds raised even if it dose not reach its goal. )
	- Fixed Funding: All contributions are returned if you don't meet your goal. Fixed goals can help give you some extra peace of mind about meeting your manufacturing targets.
